Lastman, a Catholic, had spent some time in Italy and gave a course on the treatment of biblical and mythological subjects which opened up new horizons for Rembrandt. He learnt how to arrange multi-figure compositions, and how to evoke historical place and time through he use of lavish, colourful costumes. Lastman also inspired Rembrandt's painting of The Baptism of the Eunuch, a subject favoured by both Catholics and Protestants.@1

89@RUBENS, Peter Paul@8@The Ecstasy of St Gregory the Great@1608@https://www.wga.hu/art/r/rubens/10religi/04religi.jpg@Rubens considered this commission as the confirmation of his reputation as a painter in Rome. Yet the picture was not hung in the place for which it was intended, because it reflected the light entering the church too strongly. For this reason the canvas was replaced by a new version on slate. This was quite different from the first painting; its composition was divided over three separate panels. This work, still in its original place in Santa Maria Vallicella, was ready in autumn 1608. Immediately afterwards Rubens returned to Antwerp. He took the rejected canvas with him and placed it above the tomb of his mother, Maria Pijpelinckx, who had died while he was on his way home.@1
