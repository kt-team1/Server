Lastman, a Catholic, had spent some time in Italy and gave a course on the treatment of biblical and mythological subjects which opened up new horizons for Rembrandt. He learnt how to arrange multi-figure compositions, and how to evoke historical place and time through he use of lavish, colourful costumes.
